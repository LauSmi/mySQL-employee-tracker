## Description

The challenge for this project was to build a command-line application from scratch that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The app is a content management system (CMS) that connects to my MySql database and performs quieries, as well as uses the inquirer package to interact with the user via the command line.

## Installation

This app uses inquirer.js, mysql, and console.table. Run npm install in the root directory to download these dependencies. Since it interacts with a SQL database, a SQL interface is also required.


## Usage

Once all the packages have been installed, open terminal and run the following:

npm start

This will open the command line prompts.
